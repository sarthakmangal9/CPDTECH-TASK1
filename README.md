OBJECTIVE-

DATA PROCESSING
 before applying AI algorithms, data often needs to be preprocessed to
 ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This task involves cleaning,
 transforming, and preparing raw data for AI model training

 ABOUT DATA PROCESSIONG-
 Data preprocessing is a crucial step before applying AI algorithms! Here's a basic Python program to demonstrate common data preprocessing techniques using Pandas library:

This is a simplified example, and there are many other data preprocessing techniques depending on your specific data and AI application. Some further steps you might consider include:

Encoding categorical variables: Convert categorical data (like text labels) into numerical values that machine learning algorithms can understand.
Scaling or normalization: Scale or normalize numerical features to a common range for better model performance.
Outlier handling: Identify and address outliers that may skew your data.
Remember, data preprocessing is an iterative process. You may need to explore different techniques and assess their impact on your model's performance.
